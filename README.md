# SHARP-Net: A Refined Pyramid Network for Deficiency Segmentation in Culverts and Sewer Pipes

Undetected defects in culverts and sewer pipes pose significant risks to public safety, including infrastruc- ture collapses, flooding, and transportation disruptions. Manual inspections are time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error, while existing automated methods often struggle with real-world challenges like occlusions, irregular defect shapes, class imbalances, and high resource demands. This paper in- troduces the Semantic Haar-Adaptive Refined Pyramid Network (SHARP-Net), a novel architecture for semantic segmentation that delivers precise and efficient defect detection. SHARP-Net combines multi-scale feature fusion, depth-wise separable convo- lutions, and fine-tuned Haar-like features to enhance performance while reducing computational complexity. Evaluated on the Culvert-Sewer Defects dataset and the DeepGlobe Land Cover dataset, SHARP-Net demonstrated superior performance. The base SHARP-Net (excluding Haar-like features) outperformed state-of-the-art methods, including U-Net, CBAM U-Net, ASCU- Net, FPN, and BiFPN, achieving an average improvement of 16.19% and 11.74% in IoU scores on the respective datasets, with IoU scores of 77.2% and 70.6%. The integration of Haar-like features further boosted performance by 2-4% IoU, showcasing their effectiveness in capturing critical structural details across diverse datasets. By automating defect detection, SHARP-Net addresses critical infrastructure challenges, offering a scalable solution that improves safety, reduces inspection costs, and accelerates maintenance processes.
